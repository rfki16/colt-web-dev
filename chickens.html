    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl
        of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>

    <!-- Description of Chicken  -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[18] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow
        them to fly more than a short distance.[19] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[18] Adult chickens
        of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either
        side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a
        mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[20]</p>
